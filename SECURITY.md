## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue in this project, please [open a security report issue](https://github.com/slimpagey/spotspoof-cli/issues/new?template=security_report.yml).

Since this is a public CLI tool that doesn't handle sensitive user data or credentials, security reports will be handled transparently through the issue tracker.
